### The Covia Token

The Covia Token is a decentralised digital currency for the data economy.

Use of the Covia token is **optional** - The protocol can be operated freely on a P2P basis without any usage of the token. Collaborating organisations may simply choose to utilise each other's venues directly. 

However the token will provide a number of important additional capabilities: 
- Trade and monetise data assets using decentralised smart contracts
- Create immutable, public provenance records
- Register venues to establish a public root of trust
- Accept payments in tokens, e.g. pre-payment for metered services
- Allow for decentralised governance mechanisms, such as dispute arbitration

The Covia Token is a CAD29 fungible token running on the Convex protonet / main network. The lattice technology powering Convex makes it extremely well suited as the basis for a decentralised data economy.
